# -Optimization_of_Nutrient_Composition_in_Food_Products__A_Synergistic_Approach-using-Optimization
This Jupyter Notebook contains an implementation of Genetic Algorithm, Fuzzy Logic Systems and Particle Swarm Optimization. The project focuses on optimizing the total nutrient value of a food product by considering the realistic aspects in the domain
## Overview

This notebook demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling using `pandas` and `sklearn`.
- Application of optimization techniques including Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic System, and Particle Swarm Optimization.
- Visualization and analysis of ingredient nutrient data.
- Example Case study has been implemented using the optimization algorithms.

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
pandas 
matplotlib 
scikit-learn 
deap 
scipy
pyswarm
